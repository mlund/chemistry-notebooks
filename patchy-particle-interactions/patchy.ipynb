    "In this exercise we will use the Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo algorithm to study how charged, patchy particles interact in an aquous salt solution. The model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The spherical macro-ions have a radius of 40 Å and have a fixed number of positive and negative charges on it's surface. These can be uniformly distributed (`P00.xyz`) which gives a net-charge or _monopole moment_ of -8e. They can also be unevenly distributed (`P18.xyz`) to give, in addition to the monopole moment, also a _dipole moment_.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The solvent, water, is treated as a dielectric continuum\n",
    "\n",
    "- Counter-ions and background electrolyte is also _implicit_ and described with a so-called Yukawa potential which can be derived from Debye-Hückel theory.\n",
