    "# Monte Carlo Simulation of Water\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use the Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo algorithm to study a collection of water molecules at a given temperature. As you probably know, water can be found in a number of phases - gas, liquid, ice - and its complex properties are strongly affected by water's ability to form hydrogen bonds. Here we approximate water using a so-called three-point model where oxygen and the two hydrogens are simply treated a three sites, interacting via a classical (and of course approximate) potential energy function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate the system, we will use the [_Faunus_ software](https://github.com/mlund/faunus).\n",
    "To learn more about the input and output, see the [online manual](https://faunus.readthedocs.io)."
