    "# Metropolis Monte Carlo Simulation of Water\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm to study a collection of water molecules at a given temperature. As you know water, can be found in a number of phases -- gas, liquid, ice -- and it's complex properties are strongly affected by water's ability to form hydrogen bonds. Here we approximate water using a so-called three-point model where oxygen and the two hydrogens are simply treated a three sites, interacting via a classical (and of course approximate) potential energy function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate the system, we will use the [_FAUNUS_ software](https://github.com/mlund/faunus) which is developed at Lund University, Division of Theoretical Chemistry. To lear more about the input and output, see the [online manual](https://faunus.readthedocs.io/en/v2.4.0)."
